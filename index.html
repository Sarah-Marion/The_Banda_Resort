      <h3> <em>By</em> Sarah, Derrick and Eric</h3>
      <p>Ask any still-stylish people between their mid twenties to their golden years and they’ll tell you:
        looking good takes work. And the same applies to resorts “of a certain age,” where sun, sea, sand and
        the passage of time inevitably take their toll,
        turning dazzling into dated. But the Banda (Migingo Island) is an all-inclusive resort that’s been around
        since 2008, has attempted to beat back Father Time with a top-to-toe overhaul that debuted this month.

        <h3>Cafe Tree</h3>
        <p>Make no mistake: This plantation-style breakfast and dinner venue was always a looker, with an open-air
          design centered around a sprawling centuries-old tamarind tree. But now its been given a facelift, with
          Turkish stone replacing terracotta
          floor tile; new furniture and lighting; and an updated off-white color scheme that offers a lovely contrast
          to the vibrant colors of the tropical gardens just beyond the courtyard.

      <div class="bar">
        <h3>Sugar Mill Bar</h3>
        <p>Belly up to this bar, and the first thing you’ll likely notice is that 30 years’ worth of dark varnish
          has been painstakingly stripped from the countertop, revealing the beauty of its decades-old whorls and
          natural markings. A combination of new
          chairs and stools, and illuminated floating wall shelves give the spot a more open and modern feel, and now
          that the drop ceiling has been removed, guests can fully appreciate the beauty of the former mill’s peaked roof.
        </p>

      <div class="lib">
        <h3>The Library</h3>
        <p>Adjacent to the Sugar Mill Bar and Tamarind Tree is the Library, a relaxing spot that’s Curtain Bluff’s
          social center. Guests come here to read the resort’s selection of international newspapers (yes, they’re
          old-school like that); chat with friends; and for afternoon tea, served daily promptly at 4:00 p.m. And
          now the meeting point has gone mod, with a new neutral color scheme punctuated with pops of teal and blue
          prints. New furniture is relaxed yet sophisticated, just like the resort.

        <h3>Lake Cabanas & Concierge services</h3>
        <p>On the calm and bordered by scores of coconut palms. And now there’s a new bonus on both strands.
          Surf Beach has a pair of curtain-draped Bali beds, perfectly placed for watching the sunrise. And
          on Calm Beach, concierges proffer scented cold towels and fetch fruity cocktails while you soak up the sun.
